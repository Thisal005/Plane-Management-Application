Plane Management Application
A simple console-based plane booking system developed in Java. This application allows users to buy, cancel, and manage seat bookings, as well as search and view available seats in a simulated plane environment. The system also supports displaying seating plans and printing ticket information, including total sales.


Features:
Buy a Seat: Select a seat, enter personal details, and confirm the booking.
Cancel a Seat: Cancel a previously booked seat and update the seating plan.
First Available Seat: Search for the first available seat in the plane.
Show Seating Plan: Visualize the current seating arrangement with available and booked seats.
Print Ticket Information: View and print ticket details, including the price and customer information.
Search Ticket: Find ticket details based on row and seat numbers.


How it Works:
The plane is represented as a seating array with available (0) and booked (1) seats.
Users can interact with the system through a simple text-based menu to perform various actions such as purchasing, canceling, and viewing tickets.
Ticket information is stored in a 2D array and saved to text files for each booking.
